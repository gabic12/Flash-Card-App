This Flash Card App was created with the help of Python Turtle GUI and Python pandas library.

Requirements:
 -  latest version of Python (app was created with version 3.13)
 -  pandas library (run 'pip install pandas' in the terminal)

This Flash Card app will test your knowlegde of French language. I have created a .csv file with the most used 100 French words. The app will start with a random French word displayed on a card and after 3 seconds, the card will flip revealing the English translation of that word. The user can press the âœ“ button, if he guessed the word and a new flash card will be displayed, or the X button, if he did not guessed the word - this incorrect word will be stored in a new .csv file (data/incorrect_words.csv) and the user can check the list of all French words that he needs to learn.
