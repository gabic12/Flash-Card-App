This Flash Card App was created with the help of Python Turtle GUI (Python v3.13) and Python pandas library.

Run main.py to start the app.
This Flash Card app will test your knowledge of the French language. It uses a .csv file containing the 100 most commonly used French words. The app begins by displaying a random French word on a card. After 3 seconds, the card flips to reveal its English translation. The user can press the âœ“ button if they guessed the word correctly, prompting a new flashcard to appear. If they did not guess correctly, they can press the X button, which stores the incorrect word in a separate .csv file (data/incorrect_words.csv) - this allows the user to review and focus on words they need to learn.
